Just apply the following rule: This will keep the text in your email left-aligned, but center the text in the browser: Customizing the Gmail icon of your email Unfortunately, this is out of my (or Buttondown)'s hands — the \"avatar\" or icon that shows up in an email in Gmail is just based on whether or not that email address is registered in Google's various systems. If you're sending from a Google-adjacent email address — say a domain registered in Google Suite, or a Gmail account directly — it should show up: otherwise, it won't.

I'd recommend also reading up on  Stripe's explanation of metadata  — Buttondown's implementation and philosophy behind it is very similar. What constitutes valid metadata? Internally, metadata is stored as raw JSON, so you can be pretty liberal with what you place into it. (If you try and view or set metadata using the Buttondown interface, there will likely be some stringification issues — for complex use cases, it's recommended to use the API or an integration like Zapier.) Searching for metadata You can search for metadata in Buttondown by using the   notation. For instance, if you want to find all subscribers with a metadata key-value pair of  , you type in  : At the moment, this does not work with more than one key-value pair;   will not do what you would like it to.

    "text": "Monetizing your newsletter Tiers Unfortunately, tiers are not supported at this time. Gift subscriptions Gift subscriptions are available for paid newsletters — they're a way for you to manually gate in a subscriber who you want to receive premium emails even if they haven't paid. (Like, if they're friends or family or something like that.) From Buttondown's perspective, they are a paid subscriber, but the gift recipient will never be prompted to pay and will receive a notification that they've been gifted a premium subscription. As of right now, gift subscriptions last forever. If you're interested in short-lived gift subscriptions, I recommend setting up a  free trial  for your paid newsletter! How do subscribers cancel their premium subscription? Cancelling a premium subscription is easy! Just unsubscribe from the newsletter just like any other one. If you’re interested in remaining a free subscriber, re-subscribe and you’ll be back in business. Disabling the credit card prompt for paid newsletters If you have a newsletter that is specifically based on free trials or some other bespoke flow, you might find it useful to disable the credit card prompt so prospective subscribers aren't asked to pay as soon as they put in their credit card information. You can do this by adding the   param of   to your URL. For instance, if you had a paid newsletter at, say,  , you'd change it to  ! Pay what you want In particular, Buttondown now supports a  Pay What You Want  model if you want to allow your subscribers to be patrons and support your writing without gating any specific content. You can head over to the  Paid Subscriptions  page to get started. Additionally, you can do one of two things if you’re looking for something more akin to a patronage model: Set a payment tier for your paid newsletter and then only release “free” emails. This gives subscribers the ability to sustainably support your writing without actually gating any content behind that subscription. Drop a link in your newsletter to  ko-fi  or  Buy Me a Coffee  to let folks support your work if they are so inclined. Mixing free and paid content You specify each outgoing email as a \"free\" post going to all subscribers or a \"premium\" post going to just paid subscribers. Letting premium subscribers view old premium emails To grant your premium subscribers the ability to read your full back catalog, you have two options. Using the Buttondown interface If you go to your  subscribers  page and tap on a subscriber, you'll get a customized Archives link that you can manually send them which contains a full archive of all your posts, free and premium: Using shortcodes If you want to provide a link in your emails to each subscriber's paid archive, you can use the following shortcake: This generates a unique-per-subscriber ID for their paid specific paid archives. Like the link generated through Buttondown's interface, it will expire once the subscriber's paid subscription lapses. A common tactic is to reference it in your footer for  all  paid subscribers, like so: Why Buttondown doesn't take a cut I have a longer, more rambling answer, but I'll start with the short version:  Buttondown makes money by charging for features and infrastructure . Paid newsletters is a feature, not a business model: it is a capability you get. \"But aren't incentives aligned when you take a cut of my profit?\", you might find yourself asking. Well —  sort of . It means that my incentives are very well aligned with a certain brand of writer/publication: one who is already making a whole lot of money, who has a very large social graph, and whose path of generating money is solely through paid subscriptions. There are lots of great writers who fit that profile — but most of my favorite newsletters do not. I want to make sure that I focus on the core parts of making Buttondown great: an elegant, useful interface and focus on the  writing  experience, and I wanted to intentionally choose a pricing model that fits that. \"But you charge based on subscriber count!\", you might respond. Yeah! I don't love that — it was explicitly designed to make sure that Buttondown doesn't have any customers who are  in the red,  which is to say that they are a net-negative on my bottom line. I don't have venture capital; I want this to be a sustainable business for the next twenty years, and that means I need to make sure I at least break even for each customer. The \"pay-per-thousand subscribers\" pricing is successful at that, even if its inelegant and I'd rather have a more easily-digestible pricing model at some point in the future. On a more business-minded note, I also feel that the current iteration of most paid subscription platforms — both inside and outside the world of newsletters — is a fairly naive wrapper around platform APIs like Stripe Connect. On a long-term (or even medium-term — say, three-to-five years) horizon, charging rent on top of those abstractions is not sustainable: the margin available for the taking is going to go down to zero, rather than 10% or whatever. It's important that I have a business model that is resilient to that happening. ",

Combining this with Markdown, a link would look something like: (This link will render on draft emails, but the resultant URL won't do anything of importance. I'm working on a better solution so you can 'click through' and verify that the URL is well-formed.) Tags and segmentation Buttondown offers  tags  to do this; subscribers can have one or more tags. You can send emails including (or excluding!) certain tags, making it easy to\ntailor your newsletters' content to who's going to enjoy it the most or find it the most relevant There are many ways to apply a tag to a subscriber, once you've created them: Customizing your  subscription form Manually tagging them Setting them via the  API Mail merges A mail merge is a catch-call term for sending out emails with specific fields changed. For example, being able to send out an email that says something like: Hello, {first_name}! With \"{first_name}\" being replaced by the first name of the recipient of that email. Buttondown supports mail merges through subscriber metadata. You can set metadata for a given subscriber either via the API or manually, by going to the \"Notes\" section for a given subscriber: You can then refer to metadata (such as the metadata above) in your email by using the following variable:  . You can also conditionally show a paragraph if metadata is set using a snippet like the following: Sending emails based on an RSS feed You'll want to get set up with our  Zapier integration . After sending Updating your email's slug If you update the slug of an email that's already been sent out, worry not! The old link that references an old slug will still work; Buttondown keeps track of historical slugs for each email and redirects readers who go to the old link accordingly. Updating your email's issue number Buttondown tries to be clever with determining what issue number your newsletter is on. Sometimes it is either  too  clever or not nearly clever enough, though, and you end up in a situation where your seventh issue is showing up as your eighth or vice-versa. This is particularly pernicious as a problem if you're bringing in archives from another system. You can manually edit your issue numbers by going to the  Edit Email  screen in your Archive page. The  ID  field corresponds with the issue number: In particular, Buttondown will respect your existing issue numbers and always go one greater than the largest issue number, so if you change your most recent email to be the \"right\" number everything subsequent from that should be in order. (And, of course, you can disable issue numbers altogether by signing up for Buttondown for Professionals.) Adding share links to your email You can add share links to your email by customizing your newsletter's footer in your  Design settings  page. Then, you can add custom Markdown links using some template variables that Buttondown assigns you: Interested in other social networks besides Twitter and Facebook?  Email me  and I'll add them! Caveats A warning about the in-browser preview This is a common and unfortunate question. The short answer is:  email is weird, email inboxes are weird, and there's nothing you or I or anyone can do about it.  Buttondown's markdown previewing is meant to closely resemble the inbox from a content perspective (links and HTML tags and all of those things appear as they should), but will never be able to accurate resemble the inbox from a  stylistic  perspective (things being arranged and formatted as you'd expect.) Our friends over at Litmus have a  really useful, detailed answer : Web-based email clients (such as  Outlook.com  or Gmail) will certainly perform most the tasks listed above, but they also have a larger, more difficult job. They have to prepare the HTML to be converted into HTML that's safe to show within their own email client's HTML. This is a surprisingly difficult thing to do and most web-based email clients' preprocessors will err on the side of being overly restrictive and removing anything with even the slightest potential to affect the layout of their email client. We'll cover the various mistakes made by these preprocessors a little later, but you should expect this to be the second biggest cause of headaches when designing HTML emails - the first biggest cause is still to be discussed. Why is my email all ...purple? If you're previewing multiple drafts of an email in Gmail, you might notice that the text is all purple! This isn't a Buttondown thing — this is Gmail thinking that multiple emails sent in the same day with the same subject are responses to one another, and it displays the thread of emails in a \"conversation view\". You can read about Gmail's conversation view  here : The purple colouration is a display only feature that only exists in the display where it is being seen. It is not sent in any messages and you can use Gmail's show original feature to verify that - you will need to know a little about HTML coding. The colour is applied to text that is repeated from a previous message in the current conversation and the reason it is visible to recipients is because they also are using Gmail and they also have copies of previous messages in the current conversation. What gets coloured in their conversation might be quite different from what gets coloured in yours. ",

Stripe is actually the source of truth when it comes to things like your subscribers' registered payment methods (ie credit cards) and what they've purchased / subscribed to. When you connect your Stripe account to Buttondown, you're also bringing over the history of what customers and subscribers you have and what they've paid. Over time, I'd like to make this process a little more automatic but at the moment it requires a bit of manual labor on my part to make sure everything is wired up correctly (free of charge, of course.) What this means for you is  your paying subscribers don't need to do anything extra on their end just because you're switching providers . Just email me when you've connected your Stripe account and I'll take of the rest! Importing 'founding members' Buttondown can handle the  existing  \"pay what you want\" prices for subscribers but not allow them to change the amount they're paying (beyond unsubscribing and resubscribing). Additionally, Buttondown supports a  Pay What You Want  model if you want to allow your subscribers to be patrons and support your writing without gating any specific content. You can head over to the  Paid Subscriptions  page to get started. ",

However,  paid newsletters  are a bit of a different story. Buttondown uses  Stripe  to process payments; Stripe has some restrictions on adult content. Specifically, it prohibits: Pornography and other obscene materials (including literature, imagery and other media) depicting nudity or explicitly sexual acts; sites offering any sexually-related services such as prostitution, escorts, pay-per view, adult live chat features; sexually oriented items (e.g., adult toys); adult video stores and sexually oriented massage parlors; gentleman's clubs, topless bars, and strip clubs; sexually oriented dating services Unfortunately, that means things are out of my hands: if you want to send adult content over Buttondown you cannot use its paid subscriptions functionality. Financial assistance to writers No. In the event that I  started  such a practice, I would publish information about what heuristic I used as well as a full list of writers receiving such assistance. But I will almost certainly never do this. It is a violation of Buttondown's core ethos, which is that Buttondown is a tool rather than an ecosystem — a piece of software, rather than a platform. It's important to me that people using Buttondown are, at the end of the day, writing  newsletters , not  Buttondowns .
