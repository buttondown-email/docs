Just apply the following rule:\nThis will keep the text in your email left-aligned, but center the text in the browser:\n\nUnfortunately, this is out of my (or Buttondown)'s hands — the \"avatar\" or icon that shows up in an email in Gmail is just based on whether or not that email address is registered in Google's various systems.

As of this writing, you can only apply metadata to subscribers, meaning that you can attach any sort of key-value pairs you'd like to your subscribers. This can be things like identifying information such as first and last names, so you can apply \"mail merges\" to your newsletter; or it could be for internal use only, such as customer IDs to tie subscribers back to your web application.\nI'd recommend also reading up on ,, — Buttondown's implementation and philosophy behind it is very similar.\nInternally, metadata is stored as raw JSON, so you can be pretty liberal with what you place into it. (If you try and view or set metadata using the Buttondown interface, there will likely be some stringification issues — for complex use cases, it's recommended to use the API or an integration like Zapier.)\nYou can search for metadata in Buttondown by using the ,key:value, notation. For instance, if you want to find all subscribers with a metadata key-value pair of ,{\"location\": \"Seattle\"},, you type in ,location:seattle,:\n\nAt the moment, this does not work with more than one key-value pair; ,location:seattle industry:finance, will not do what you would like it to.

(Like, if they're friends or family or something like that.) From Buttondown's perspective, they are a paid subscriber, but the gift recipient will never be prompted to pay and will receive a notification that they've been gifted a premium subscription.\nAs of right now, gift subscriptions last forever. If you're interested in short-lived gift subscriptions, I recommend setting up a ,, for your paid newsletter!\nCancelling a premium subscription is easy! Just unsubscribe from the newsletter just like any other one.\nIf you’re interested in remaining a free subscriber, re-subscribe and you’ll be back in business.\nIf you have a newsletter that is specifically based on free trials or some other bespoke flow, you might find it useful to disable the credit card prompt so prospective subscribers aren't asked to pay as soon as they put in their credit card information.\nYou can do this by adding the ,GET, param of ,without_payment_prompt, to your URL.\nFor instance, if you had a paid newsletter at, say, ,https://buttondown.email/weeknotes,, you'd change it to ,https://buttondown.email/weeknotes?without_payment_prompt=true,!\nIn particular, Buttondown now supports a ,, model if you want to allow your subscribers to be patrons and support your writing without gating any specific content. You can head over to the ,, page to get started.\nAdditionally, you can do one of two things if you’re looking for something more akin to a patronage model:\nYou specify each outgoing email as a \"free\" post going to all subscribers or a \"premium\" post going to just paid subscribers.\nTo grant your premium subscribers the ability to read your full back catalog, you have two options.\nIf you go to your ,, page and tap on a subscriber, you'll get a customized Archives link that you can manually send them which contains a full archive of all your posts, free and premium:\n\nIf you want to provide a link in your emails to each subscriber's paid archive, you can use the following shortcake:\nThis generates a unique-per-subscriber ID for their paid specific paid archives. Like the link generated through Buttondown's interface, it will expire once the subscriber's paid subscription lapses. A common tactic is to reference it in your footer for ,, paid subscribers, like so:\nI have a longer, more rambling answer, but I'll start with the short version: ,,. Paid newsletters is a feature, not a business model: it is a capability you get.\n\"But aren't incentives aligned when you take a cut of my profit?\", you might find yourself asking.\nWell — ,,. It means that my incentives are very well aligned with a certain brand of writer/publication: one who is already making a whole lot of money, who has a very large social graph, and whose path of generating money is solely through paid subscriptions. There are lots of great writers who fit that profile — but most of my favorite newsletters do not. I want to make sure that I focus on the core parts of making Buttondown great: an elegant, useful interface and focus on the ,, experience, and I wanted to intentionally choose a pricing model that fits that.\n\"But you charge based on subscriber count!\", you might respond.\nYeah! I don't love that — it was explicitly designed to make sure that Buttondown doesn't have any customers who are ,, which is to say that they are a net-negative on my bottom line. I don't have venture capital; I want this to be a sustainable business for the next twenty years, and that means I need to make sure I at least break even for each customer. The \"pay-per-thousand subscribers\" pricing is successful at that, even if its inelegant and I'd rather have a more easily-digestible pricing model at some point in the future.\nOn a more business-minded note, I also feel that the current iteration of most paid subscription platforms — both inside and outside the world of newsletters — is a fairly naive wrapper around platform APIs like Stripe Connect. On a long-term (or even medium-term — say, three-to-five years) horizon, charging rent on top of those abstractions is not sustainable: the margin available for the taking is going to go down to zero, rather than 10% or whatever. It's important that I have a business model that is resilient to that happening.\n",

You can just drag and drop them into the main text area of your email; it'll be automatically uploaded to S3 and inserted into the text.\nButtondown uses Amazon S3 (a fairly common file hosting platform) to safely and securely store your images. They last indefinitely by default; there's no interface to delete images that you've uploaded to Buttondown, but you can do so via the API (or email me and I can manually delete them on your behalf.) This means that even if you were to delete the email in which images are referenced, the images themselves still exist on Buttondown's servers.\nThis answer assumes a baseline familiarity with Markdown.\nButtondown automatically appends an unsubscribe link to the footer of all emails you send, but you may want to manually place one in your email as well (for instance, at the top of the email, if it's an infrequent newsletter). To generate the unsubscription URL, use the ,{{ unsubscribe_url }}, shortcode.\nCombining this with Markdown, a link would look something like:\n(This link will render on draft emails, but the resultant URL won't do anything of importance.

For example, being able to send out an email that says something like:\nWith \"{first_name}\" being replaced by the first name of the recipient of that email.\nButtondown supports mail merges through subscriber metadata. You can set metadata for a given subscriber either via the API or manually, by going to the \"Notes\" section for a given subscriber:\n\nYou can then refer to metadata (such as the metadata above) in your email by using the following variable: ,{{ subscriber.metadata.first_name }},.\nYou can also conditionally show a paragraph if metadata is set using a snippet like the following:\nYou'll want to get set up with our ,,.\nIf you update the slug of an email that's already been sent out, worry not!

The ,, field corresponds with the issue number:\n\nIn particular, Buttondown will respect your existing issue numbers and always go one greater than the largest issue number, so if you change your most recent email to be the \"right\" number everything subsequent from that should be in order.\n(And, of course, you can disable issue numbers altogether by signing up for Buttondown for Professionals.)\nYou can add share links to your email by customizing your newsletter's footer in your ,, page.\nThen, you can add custom Markdown links using some template variables that Buttondown assigns you:\nInterested in other social networks besides Twitter and Facebook? ,, and I'll add them!\nThis is a common and unfortunate question.
