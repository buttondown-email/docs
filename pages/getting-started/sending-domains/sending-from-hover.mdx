# Sending from a custom domain - Hover

Sending from a custom domain?!  What is this? Why is it important?  <a

1. [Log in](https://buttondown.email/login) to your Buttondown account. Click on the menu in the top right corner and select “Your newsletter”.
2. Your Email address must match your custom sending domain. (If your sending domain is fictile.space, your email has to be name@fictile.space; name@gmail.com won’t work.) Change it if needed.

 6. Add the TXT record(s) - Follow the steps below for each record that has “TXT” in the “TYPE” dropdown menu:

   1. Click “ADD A RECORD”.  (Red circle on the left in screenshot above.)

7.  Add the CNAME records - Follow the steps below for each record that has “CNAME” in the “TYPE” column:
    
    1. Click “ADD A RECORD”.

    2. Select “CNAME” from the "type" dropdown menu.  (Green arrow on the left in screenshot below.)

    3. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "KEY" column.  In Hover, paste it in the "“HOSTNAME”" field. (Red arrow in the middle in screenshot below.)

8. If it were a pie, you’d wait for it to bake. But it’s computers, so Hover can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to go bake a pie.
9. Click “Check records” in Buttondown. If they all come up with green checkmarks, it means your DNS records are done propagating. You’re good to go!
