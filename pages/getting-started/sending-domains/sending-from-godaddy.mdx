1. [Log in](https://buttondown.email/login) to your Buttondown account. Click on the menu in the top right corner and select “Your newsletter”.
2. Your Email address must match your custom sending domain. (If your sending domain is buttondown.xyz, your email has to be name@buttondown.xyz; name@gmail.com won’t work.) Change it if needed.

8. If it were a pie, you’d wait for it to bake. But it’s computers, so GoDaddy can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to go bake a pie.
9. Click “Check records” in Buttondown. If they all come up with green checkmarks, it means your DNS records are done propagating. You’re good to go!
