1. [Log in](https://buttondown.email/login) to your Buttondown account. Click on the menu in the top right corner and select “Your newsletter”.
2. Your Email address must match your custom sending domain. (If your sending domain is buttondown.xyz, your email has to be name@buttondown.xyz; name@gmail.com won’t work.) Change it if needed.

8. If it were a pie, you’d wait for it to bake. But it’s computers, so NearlyFreeSpeech.NET can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to go bake a pie.
9. Click “Check records” in Buttondown. If they all come up with green checkmarks, it means your DNS records are done propagating. You’re good to go!

## Troubleshooting


### Did you remember to add a dot (".") at the end of the "Data" field for CNAME records?

NearlyFreeSpeech.NET requires a dot (".") at the end of any CNAME Data that points to a domain other than your own.  When you copy and paste something  from Buttondown's "NEEDED" column like:
```
lquhjw4i2i5ucs72wfo72hamq34c72im.dkim.amazonses.com
```
you have to **add the dot at the end** in NearlyFreeSpeech.Net's "Data field", so it looks like:

<code>lquhjw4i2i5ucs72wfo72hamq34c72im.dkim.amazonses.com.</code>

### Are your DNS records still propagating?

I know setting up DNS records is a pain! If it's been 24 hours and you're still not seeing the records get validated in the way you expect, [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I'm happy to help!
