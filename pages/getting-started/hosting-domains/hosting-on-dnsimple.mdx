6. Click on the "ADD A RECORD" button. (Red circle on the left in screenshot above.)
7. Add the CNAME record - Take the information from the Buttondown popup and put it into DNSimple:

   1. Click the blue "Add Record" button.
   2. Choose "CNAME" from the drop-down menu.
   4. In Buttondown, copy everything before ".fictile.space" from the "KEY" column.  In DNSimple, paste it in the "Name" field. (Pink arrow on the left in screenshot below.)
   5. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In DNSimple, paste it in the "Content" field.  (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)

8. If it were tea, you’d wait for it to steep. But it’s computers, so DNSimple can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to enjoy a cup of tea.

9. Click “Check records” in Buttondown. If it gives you a green checkmark, that means your DNS records are done propagating. You’re good to go!

##  Troubleshooting

### Did you get an HTTPS error when you tried to go to your custom hosting domain?

This is normal and temporary.  Your DNS records are still propogating!

###  Are your DNS records still propagating?

I know setting up DNS records is a pain! If it's been 24 hours and you're still not seeing the records get validated in the way you expect, <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">email me</a> and I'm happy to help!
