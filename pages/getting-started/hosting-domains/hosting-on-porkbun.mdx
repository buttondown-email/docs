5. In another tab, [log in to your Porkbun account](https://porkbun.com/account/login). Click the "Details" button to the right of the domain you want to send emails from (pink circle in screenshot below).  Click the "Edit" link in the "DNS RECORDS" section (green circle in screenshot below).

6.  Add the CNAME record - Follow the steps below for the record that has “CNAME” in the “TYPE” column:

    1. In Porkbun, select "CNAME - Canonical name record" from the "Type" dropdown menu.
    2. In Buttondown, copy everything before ".buttondown.xyz" from the "KEY" column.  In Porkbun, paste it in the "Host" field. (Pink arrow on the left in screenshot below.)
    3. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In Porkbun, paste it in the "Answer" field.  (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)
    4. Click “Add”.

7. If it were tea, you’d wait for it to steep. But it’s computers, so Porkbun can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to enjoy some tea.

8. Click “Check records” in Buttondown. If it gives you a green checkmark, that means your DNS records are done propagating. You’re good to go!

##  Troubleshooting

### Did you get an HTTPS error when you tried to go to your custom hosting domain?

This is normal and temporary.  Your DNS records are still propogating!

###  Are your DNS records still propagating?

I know setting up DNS records is a pain! If it's been 24 hours and you're still not seeing the records get validated in the way you expect, <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">email me</a> and I'm happy to help!
