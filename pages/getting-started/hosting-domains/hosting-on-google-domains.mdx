# Hosting on a custom domain - Google Domains

Hosting on a custom domain?!  What is this? Why is it important?  <a

1. Log in to your Buttondown account. Click on the menu in the top right corner and select “Your newsletter”.

2. Enter your custom hosting domain.

3.  Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the blue "Update settings" bar.
4. Scroll back up to where you entered your custom hosting domain.  Look for the red alert.  Click on the "Click here" link.

5. In another tab, go to your [Google Domains Control Panel](domains.google.com/).   If you have more than one Google domain, use the domain name you want to send Buttondown emails from.

6. From the menu on the left, click “DNS”.

7. Take the information from the Buttondown popup and put it in Google Domains:

   1. In Buttondown, copy everything before ".hebetu.de" from the "KEY" column.  In Google Domains, paste it in the "Host name" column. (Pink arrow on the left in screenshot below.)
   2. Choose CNAME from the dropdown "Type" menu.
   3. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In Google Domains, paste it in the "Data" column.  (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)

8. If it were tea, you’d wait for it to steep. But it’s computers, so Google Domains can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to enjoy some tea.

9. Click “Check records” in Buttondown. If it gives you a green checkmark, that means your DNS records are done propagating. You’re good to go!

##  Troubleshooting

### Did you get an HTTPS error when you tried to go to your custom hosting domain?

This is normal and temporary.  Your DNS records are still propogating!

###  Are your DNS records still propagating?

I know setting up DNS records is a pain! If it's been 24 hours and you're still not seeing the records get validated in the way you expect, <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">email me</a> and I'm happy to help!
