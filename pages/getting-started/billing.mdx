### Reaching the free tier's cap

Buttondown is free for your **first thousand subscribers** and requires a small monthly fee for more than that, because sending emails and running servers ain't cheap! (You can read more on our [pricing page](https://buttondown.email/pricing).)

That being said, it would be awful if you suddenly hit a thousand subscribers and didn't have a chance to register a credit card and so additional subscribers would be shown the door â€” that doesn't happen! You can continue to accrue subscribers past a thousand, you just can't send any emails to them until you fill out your [billing information](https://buttondown.email/settings/billing).

### Non-profit discount

Buttondown does not offer a non-profit discount at the moment.

### Annual discount

Yes! Two months free every year with an annual purchase. Email me and I'll get you set up.
