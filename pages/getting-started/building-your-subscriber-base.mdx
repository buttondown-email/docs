# Building your subscriber base

## Using HTML

Go over to the [embedding and sharing page](https://buttondown.email/share) and Buttondown will walk you through exactly how this is done:

![A screenshot of the embedding and sharing page.](/images/embed-form.png)

You can see what this looks like below:

<Playground
  hideCSS
  html={`<form
  action="
    https://buttondown.email/api/emails/
  "
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input
    type="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="you@gmail.com"
  />
  <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed" />
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
  <p>
    <a href="https://buttondown.email" target="_blank">
        Powered by Buttondown.
    </a>
  </p>
</form>`}
/>

## Adding tags to your subscribers

**Using query parameters**

If you're using Buttondown's subscribe page (e.g. `https://buttondown.email/jmduke`), you can automatically add new tags to new subscribers by adding a **query parameter** to the URL, such as:

```markup
https://buttondown.email/jmduke?tag=python
```

This will automatically give folks who subscribe through the link a tag named `python`.

If you want to apply multiple tags at once, you can add multiple such query parameters:

```markup
https://buttondown.email/jmduke?tag=python&tag=vue
```

**Using HTML**

If you'd prefer to use HTML, augment your form to add an `input` tag with a name of `tag`. (You can supply multiple inputs; Buttondown will apply _all_ tags.)

An example is below. Note that the `value` associated with the tag being passed over is the _name_ of the tag, not the _ID_; you can in fact supply either one and Buttondown
will do the right thing (including automatically creating a tag with the given name if no such tag exists).

<Playground
  html={`<form
  action="
    https://buttondown.email/api/emails/
  "
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input
    type="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="you@gmail.com"
  />
  <label for="email">Pokemon</label>
  <br />
  <input type="radio" id="Squirtle" name="tag" value="Squirtle">
  <label for="Squirtle">Squirtle</label>
  <input type="radio" id="Bulbasaur" name="tag" value="Bulbasaur">
  <label for="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</label>
  <input type="radio" id="Charmander" name="tag" value="Charmander">
  <label for="Charmander">Charmander</label><br>
  <br />
  <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed" />
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
  <p>
    <a href="https://buttondown.email" target="_blank">
        Powered by Buttondown.
    </a>
  </p>
</form>`}
/>

## Adding metadata to your subscribers

**On your Buttondown subscribe form**

Buttondown's subscription form doesn't ask for any metadata by default; it's only interested in your subscribers' email address.
(And their payment information, if you're running a paid newsletter.)

If you're interested in collecting more information, though, you can add _custom subscribe form inputs_. (This is a bit of a mouthful, I know!) You can find these
at the bottom of your [design settings page](https://buttondown.email/settings/design). Inputs have three attributes:

1. A **key**, which corresponds with the key that will be set in the metadata for your subscriber.
2. A **label**, which is the text that will be displayed to the user.
3. Whether or not the metadata is **required**. If the metadata is required, then the input is required to be filled out by the subscriber.

**Using HTML**

I'm a fan of showing, not telling, so I'll lead with the relevant code sample:

[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/buttondown/t53cr4gy/21/)

The trick is to set inputs with the `name` of `metadata__<key>`, as you can see in the code sample above:

```markup
<input
  id="first-name"
  type="text"
  name="metadata__first-name"
  required
  placeholder="John"
/>
```

Note that these can be freeform text inputs, like above, or `hidden` inputs if you instead want to invisibly augment your subscription forms with given metadata. (For instance, you can imagine setting metadata for everyone coming through a particular tag or webpage.)

Another example playground is below:

<Playground
  html={`<form
  action="
    https://buttondown.email/api/emails/
  "
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input
    type="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="you@gmail.com"
  />
  <label for="first-name">First name</label>
  <input
  id="first-name"
  type="text"
  name="metadata__first-name"
  required
  placeholder="John"
/>
  <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed" />
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
  <p>
    <a href="https://buttondown.email" target="_blank">
        Powered by Buttondown.
    </a>
  </p>
</form>`}
/>

## Automatically sending an email to new subscribers

You can do this by going to your [Subscribing settings page](https://buttondown.email/settings/subscribing) and checking out the section entitled **I'd like to send my new subscribers...**:

## Dealing with spammy subscribers

Chances are, this is because you're using an embedded subscription widget and you don't have subscription confirmation turned on. First off — you should turn that on!

I'll be building out captcha support in the future as well but in the meantime, if you still are seeing lots of spammy subscribers [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I'll take a look.

## FAQs

### Captcha support

I am piloting a program using [https://www.hcaptcha.com/](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) and will be bringing it (on an opt-in basis) to GA soon!

### Instagram

Instagram's browser is a little, uh, finicky. Take out the `target="popupwindow"` attribute from the form tag and you should be good to go.

### medium

To embed your subscription widget in Medium, all you need to do is post the link to your newsletter (e.g. https://buttondown.email/jmduke) in Medium — it should automatically embed.
