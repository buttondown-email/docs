# Affiliate program

Yes!

We offer an affiliate program for you to recommend Buttondown to your audience while recurring a recurring **25%** **commission** on all customers you send our way. It's easy to get set up:

1. **Sign up for Buttondown**. Hopefully this one is easy â€” you should be using Buttondown to promote it, after all! Understanding what Buttondown offers as a tool and how it can help your audience is key.
2. **Share Buttondown with your audience**. Use a `utm_campaign` of your Buttondown username and a `utm_affiliate` of `affiliate`.
3. **Sit back and wait for an email**. I'm manually sending remittances at the moment, so I'll reach out to you once you have payouts ready! (I will automate this at some point, I promise.)
