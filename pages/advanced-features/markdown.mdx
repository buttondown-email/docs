## Buttondown's Markdown rendering engine

Buttondown's Markdown rendering engine is [Python-Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown)

### Extensions

In addition, Buttondown uses a handful of extensions:

- [smarty](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/smarty/), to convert ASCII characters into HTML entities
- [tables](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/tables/), to allow basic tables
- [footnotes](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/footnotes/), to allow basic footnotes. (These are rendered in your online archives using [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com))
- [fenced_code](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/), to allow a more common approach for embedding code snippets
- [pymdownx.tilde](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/tilde/), for allowing of deletions and subscripts
- [CodeHilite](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/), for syntax highlighting of code snippets

### Embeds

In addition to all of _those_, Buttondown uses some proprietary extensions for embedding things like tweets, YouTube videos, and gifs â€” but none of these should affect your general rendering experience.

If you're looking for an escape hatch out of these embeds, they only trigger on links that are on self-contained lines, like the following:

```markdown
Here is a tweet I liked!

https://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/1352057677359288321
```

So you can avoid it by simply doing something like:

```markdown
Here is a tweet I liked!

<div>https://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/1352057677359288321</div>
```
