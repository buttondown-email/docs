# Mailcoach

### Importing your subscribers

1. Export your Mailcoach subscribers [here](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v4/using-mailcoach/audience#exporting-subscribers).
2. Go to [https://buttondown.email/settings](https://buttondown.email/settings). You may need to log in first.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
4. Click the _Import subscribers_ button at the bottom of the page, then choose the csv file you just downloaded from AWeber

### Importing your archives (campaigns)

<Notice variant="info">
  Mailcoach campaigns are like Buttondown archives.
</Notice>

According to Mailcoach (as of January 2022), "there is no way to export \[campaigns] in the interface." You can, however, retrieve all of your campaigns [via the API](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v4/using-the-api/campaigns). Once you get your data, [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I’ll help you with importing your archives.


### You did it!

Once you finish all of the above steps, Buttondown will kick off an audit and migration process to make sure everything is in order. Then you should be safe to disable or deactivate your AWeber account.


### By the way

With Buttondown, it’s easy to [export _all_ your data](https://docs.buttondown.email/odds-and-ends/exporting-your-data):
