3. Scroll to the bottom of the page.  
4. Click the _Import subscribers_ button at the bottom of the page, then choose the .csv file you just downloaded from Campaign Monitor.

### Importing your archives (emails/templates)

<Notice variant="info">
Campaign Monitor emails/templates are like Buttondown archives.
</Notice>
&nbsp;

According to Campaign Monitor (as of December 2021), “_There’s currently no way to export the HTML and CSS files of our in-app drag and drop builder emails/templates._”

You can also try [reaching out to Campaign Monitor](https://help.createsend.com/admin/how-to-get-help) and see if they will export your emails for you. Once they give you access to your data, [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I’ll help you with importing your archives.


### You did it!

Once you finish the above steps, Buttondown will kick off an audit and migration process to make sure everything is in order. Then you should be safe to disable or deactivate your Campaign Monitor account.


### By the way

With Buttondown, it’s easy to [export _all_ your data](https://docs.buttondown.email/odds-and-ends/exporting-your-data):
