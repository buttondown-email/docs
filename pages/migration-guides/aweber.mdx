### Importing your subscribers (contacts)

</Notice>
&nbsp;

1. Export your AWeber contacts [here](https://help.aweber.com/hc/en-us/articles/204028816-How-do-I-export-my-subscribers-).

2. Go to [https://buttondown.email/settings](https://buttondown.email/settings). You may need to log in first.  
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page.  
4. Click the _Import subscribers_ button at the bottom of the page, then choose the csv file you just downloaded from AWeber

### Importing your archives (campaigns)

<Notice variant="info">
AWeber campaigns are like Buttondown archives.
</Notice>

According to AWeber (as of November 2021), "Currently, there is no way to back up campaign messages specifically." "You can always send yourself tests of campaign messages to have them for your record that way, but we currently don't have an option to download campaign messages from directly within the account."

You can try [reaching out to them](https://www.aweber.com/contact-us.htm) and see if they will export your campaigns for you. Once they give you access to your data, [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I’ll take care of importing your archives.


### You did it!

Once you finish all of the above steps, Buttondown will kick off an audit and migration process to make sure everything is in order. Then you should be safe to disable or deactivate your AWeber account.


### Do subscribers need to re-enter their credit card?

Yes. Benchmark uses Paypal to process payments. Buttondown uses the payments processor [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Unfortunately, it's not possible to transfer payment information for your Benchmark subscribers over to Buttondown.


### By the way

With Buttondown, it’s easy to [export _all_ your data](https://docs.buttondown.email/odds-and-ends/exporting-your-data):
