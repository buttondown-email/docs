### Importing your subscribers

2. Go to [https://buttondown.email/settings](https://buttondown.email/settings). You may need to log in first.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
4. Click the _Import subscribers_ button at the bottom of the page, then choose the csv file you just downloaded from MailerLite.

### Importing your archives (newsletters)

<Notice variant="info">
MailerLite newsletters are the same as Buttondown archives.
</Notice>


According to MailerLite (as of November 2021): Newsletters “have to be downloaded as individual PDFs”

You can save or print your newsletters (one at a time) as PDFs [here](https://www.mailerlite.com/help/how-to-export-a-newsletter-as-pdf). [Email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I’ll help you with importing those PDFs.


### You did it!

Once you finish all of the above steps, Buttondown will kick off an audit and migration process to make sure everything is in order. Then you should be safe to disable or deactivate your MailerLite account.


### By the way

With Buttondown, it’s easy to [export _all_ your data](https://docs.buttondown.email/odds-and-ends/exporting-your-data):
