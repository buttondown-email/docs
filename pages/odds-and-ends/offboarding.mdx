If you want to delete your Buttondown account, no hard feelings! Hit the "delete your account" button
at the bottom of your [Account page](https://buttondown.email/account) and our data will be _instantly_
removed from our servers. (There's no recovering this, so be sure to [export your data](/odds-and-ends/exporting-your-data) beforehand if you need your data!)
