# Changelog

The changelog provides a list of dated updates, each of which contains a number of potentially backwards-incompatible changes. There is no explicit versioning in the API at this time; all changes will be either compatible or breaking. (If I attempt any brittle changes to the API that may break current implementations, I'll be sure to add version gates.)

### 2021-01-02

Added support to set and retrieve metadata on Emails.

### 2020-12-23

Added deletion and update abilities to the Scheduled emails endpoint, giving you much more programmability than the hitherto append-only state of the world.

### 2020-12-09

Added a deletion endpoint to the Images endpoint, allowing you to delete unused images.
